Build a 64-bit arithmetic shift register, with synchronous load. The shifter can shift both left and right, and by 1 or 8 bit positions, selected by amount. An arithmetic right shift shifts in the sign bit of the number in the shift register (q[63] in this case) instead of zero as done by a logical right shift. An arithmetic right shift assumes the number being shifted is signed, and preserves the sign.
load: Loads shift register with data[63:0] instead of rotating.
ena: Chooses whether to shift.
amount: Chooses which direction and how much to shift.
2'b00: shift left by 1 bit.
2'b01: shift left by 8 bits.
2'b10: shift right by 1 bit.
2'b11: shift right by 8 bits.
q: The contents of the shifter.
